# bottelegram
Bot to automatic message sending through telegram.
- you need to be logged in your telegram account on your webrowser;
- your operating system must be Windows;
- your browser must be Chrome, though it's not difficult to do the due code modifications;
- profiles that do not have pics and thus cannot be reached by anyone won't work with this bot.

The following packages are required to the bot running:

```python
!pip install pyautogui
!pip install pyperclip
```
You can run it directly from jupyter-notebook/collab or your can run it in your terminal by taking of the exclamation points.
It is also important to mention that your computer should preferably be with IDEL screen open only.
