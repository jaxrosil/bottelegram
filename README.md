# bottelegram
Bot to automatic message sending through telegram.
- you need to be logged in your telegram account on your browser;
- your operating system must be Windows;
- your browser must be Chrome, though it's not difficult to do the due code modifications;
- profiles that do not have pics and thus cannot be reached by anyone won't work with this bot.

The following packages are required to run the bot:

```python
!pip install pyautogui
!pip install pyperclip
```
You can run it directly from jupyter-notebook/collab or you can run it in your terminal by taking off the exclamation points.
It is also important to mention your computer should preferably be with your IDLE screen open only.
